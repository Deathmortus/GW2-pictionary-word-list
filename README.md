_A project for fun guild evenings._

My love for classics and my GW2 guild planted the seed of a fun idea:  **Guild Wars 2-themed Pictionaries**!

I tried at first to create a list for [this online pictionary that allows custom lists](skribbl.io) but after a few games, we noticed that my list was not so long and that we were doing the same words again and again. Then, we thought, other guilds might be interested, right? What about sharing this project with other GW2 players from all over the world?

## Hows 

### How to use
Copy/paste the part you want to use into your pictionary client, I told you about _skribbl.io_ but this one allows online up to 12 players. 
#### On _skribbl.io_
* Create a private game
* In the text area, simply paste the words you wanna use. 
* Don't forget to check "Only use custom words"

### How to contribute
Online: Edit the files with your words, this will create a request. I'll analyze this request and add it if the content is correct.

Each word should be separated from the others with a comma. Carriage returns are not taken into account but I recommend doing some in order to have a better looking file. 

Example: 
```
sylvari,norn,charr,human,asura,
kodan,krait,skritt,
```

**Note:** I know that difficulty depends on the point of view, but keep in mind that some stuff are really hard to guess and draw: a spider vs Vlast, Lion's Arch vs Orr's magician tower. 

#### WARNING
Be careful with words using `'` character, it won't work in _skribbl.io_ (maybe other clients), and would look like this: 
```
                     word: Lion's Arch
how it appears in skribbl: Lions Arch
```
